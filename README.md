# DelugeScreenPio
### A slightly cheaper alternative, with some extra features
I made this to be a cheaper alternative to getting your deluge sent for a upgrade.  Even if I already paid for it. It uses the USB port of a USBA host feather to handle midi with PIO, and takes power from the USB C to charge the deluge/onboard battery.

Still a WIP, so features such as MIDI CC encoders, more button functionality, static screens, 7segment support, etc will be added as I feel like it.

## Bill of Materials
For the minimal version, you only need the Feather, OLED, and headers to connect them.  Everything else is optional.
